# Coding Portfolio

## Description

I have made a portfolio webpage in which it has a section about me, my work, and a contact section. When each section is clicked in the links at the top of the page it takes you to each of the following sections. When the page is shrinked the text will follow a wrap around the fit in the new page. 

## Acceptance Criteria for the Assignment
